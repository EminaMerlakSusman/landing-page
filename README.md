This is a sample landing page I made when I was self-learning how to make websites. It is written in HTML, Javascript and CSS. It is a single-page application. It features an effect where if your cursor is not on the page, the background image is blurred and the text is focused on, but when you move your cursor to the page, the text blurs and the background image is put into focus.
